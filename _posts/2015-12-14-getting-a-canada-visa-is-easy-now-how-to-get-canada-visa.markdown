	International Experience Canada (IEC) provides young individuals the opportunity to travel and work in Canada. As of November 21, 2015, there is a new application process to become an IEC participant.  IEC is available in countries and territories that have a bilateral youth mobility agreement with Canada. If the country does not have an agreement with Canada, then there is a way to use a Recognized Organization to come to Canada under IEC.
