	Hound is a natural language processing engine with hands free app came from SoundHound Inc like Google Now, Siri and Cortana. Why we need a discussion about Hound as already we have Google Now or Siri? SoundHound Inc says that "Hound's Speech-to-Meaning engine delivers unrivaled speed and accuracy. Speech recognition and natural language understanding is done simultaneously and in real time. Compared to traditional approaches that perform speech recognition first, then send the result to a search or understanding engine, Hound does it immediately".
