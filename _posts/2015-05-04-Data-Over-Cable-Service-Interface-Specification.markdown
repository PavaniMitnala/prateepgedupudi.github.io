<p>Hathway initially started with provider of cable tv(CATV)network over major cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad. It experimented of sending data through the same cable network in Chennai city by using DOCSIS(Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification).</p>

<p>DOCSIS was developed by CableLabs and contributing companies, including 3Com, ARRIS, BigBand Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, Conexant, Correlant, Harmonic, Intel, Motorola, Netgear, Technicolor, Terayon, and Texas Instruments. In the UK, broadband provider Virgin Media announced on 20 April 2011 an intention to start trials with download speeds of 1.5 Gbit/s and upload of 150 Mbit/s based on DOCSIS 3.0. This is the highest data transfer rate happens so far with DOCSIS 3.0.</p>

<p>Hathway re implemented its data transfer technology with DOCSIS 3.0 with the help of Cisco. Now they are able to provide 50 Mbit/s down and 6-10 Mbit/s up speeds to all their customers. I feel now with DOCSIS 3.0, Hathway is very good competitor to other major broadband providers in India.</p>
