<h2 class="section-heading">Big Data Definition:</h2>
<blockquote>Bit data are a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications</blockquote>
<p>
	Lets devide Big Data into parts by its definition
	<span class="caption text-muted">Bit data are a collection of data sets</span>
	We are saying colletion of data sets because data sets from different sources about the same subject. Lets take an example of creating new insurance product in banking industry. Bank already has a data of all its customer's bank account data which is one type of data set. Bank has its own website which has many activities like comments(This is also a one type of data set). Bank has transaction logs in its applications which can be treated as data set. We have very high data under social media which can be assume as one type of data set. All the above collection of data sets are sources to create best insurance product.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="caption text-muted">large and complex</span>
	Data sets grow in size in part because they are increasingly being gathered from several years. All the data sets will not be in same format. For example social media data can be get in json/text format which is entirely dirrent format from applications logs data format. So it is complex in processing of different data sets.
</p>
<p>
	<span class="caption text-muted">difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications</span>
	We are getting most of the data in unstructured format which is not possible to store in traditional database tools.So traditional data processing applications are inadequate to process big data. Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy.
