<p>Setting the ringtone in moto devices is little bit tricky. I would like to show how to set the personalized ringtone in moto devices.I am using moto e and recording my screen with screen recording software. Please have a look. First let download ES file explorer. It is less than 10 MB. You can download it from play store. With this you can change file permissions and even folder permissions as well. Let me show you how ES file explorer will look. This is the down load link from play store. After downloading it, lets open the ES file explorer. With ES file explorer you can see images, music, movies, documents and even apps also. From the home page you can see internal memory as well as SD card. Lets look at the music file which you are going to use it for a ring tone. I am going to use this Sad Heart Touch music file as my ring tone. So now go to the settings. There you can go for Sound and Notification. Click on Phone ringtone. Now it will ask for media storage as well as ES file explorer. Now just select ES file exploere as JUSTONCE. So it will show all the folders and files under SDcard. You can select required music file from here. So that it will be set as ring tone. Thanks for watching.
